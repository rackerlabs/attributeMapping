# Releases #
## Release 2.3.0 (2018-05-08) ##
1. Block new XPath 3.1 functions such as json-doc.
   1. We now use a REx based XPath 3.1 parser as the Saxon parser does not produce a clean parse tree.
1. Clean up: Include log4j2 config files in CLI utils and tests so that messages are not lost.
1. Clean up: No longer create a new XSLT Compiler on every request.
1. Clean up: Provide consistent exception handling with new Exception types based off of `AttributeMapperException`.
1. Added reference manual in docs.

## Release 2.2.1 (2018-04-16) ##
1. Fixed a memory leak when compiling and validating policies.

## Release 2.2.0 (2017-10-30) ##
1. Clean up: Improve extended attributes in XML.
   1. Denote that `multiValue` attribute is `false` if not specifed.
   1. Ensure that SAML and internal namespaces don't leak into the `RAX-AUTH:extendedAttributes` element.
1. An empty extended attribute is now represented as having a `null` value (or an empty array) in `RAX-AUTH:extendedAttributes` in JSON.
   1. The previous behavior was to not output an extended attribute at all if it was empty.

## Release 2.1.1 (2017-10-24) ##
1. Updated Dependency
    1. checker-util: 2.4.1 → 2.5.1

## Release 2.1.0 (2017-10-23) ##
1. Disallow inline functions in policy path expressions.
1. Fixed a bug where multi-value attributes were not always returned as an array when generating JSON output.
1. We now support `groups` as a standard attribute, which supports default value with {D}
   1. As a result of the change, standard attributes will no longer be set in the SAML assertion if they are not specified in the mapping policy.
1. We now set `mapping:multiValue` in a SAML attribute to denote whether the attribute may hold several values.
   1. Setting `mapping:multiValue` helps in conversion to JSON when setting extended attributes via the `RAX-AUTH:extendedAttributes`.

## Release 2.0.1 (2017-09-28) ##
1. Fixed a number of parsing bugs when using {(P|A)ts?()} in a template that spans multiple lines.

## Release 2.0.0 (2017-09-25) ##
1. Added the ability to specify default values ({D}) via configuration (defaults.xml) for standard attributes. Several places may be searched for values via XPath, SAML attribute name, or via passed in parameters.
1. Updated Dependency
    1. checker-util: 2.4.0 → 2.4.1

## Release 1.3.1 (2017-08-29) ##
1. Updated Dependencies
    1. saxon: 9.7.0-8 → 9.8.0-4
    1. wadl-tools: 1.0.33 → 1.0.37
    1. checker-util: 2.1.1 → 2.4.0
1. Fixed a bug where we checked XPath syntax against XPath 3.1 but only supported 2.0 -- we now support XPath 3.1 fully.

## Release 1.3.0 (2017-08-14) ##
1. Fixed a bug when converting values with {(P|A)ts()} from XML to JSON
1. Added JSON to YAML conversion with CLI support.
1. Disallowing available-environment-variables, collection, document, environment-variable, unparsed-text-available, unparsed-text, unparsed-text-lines, and uri-collection functions in policy path expressions.
   Also disallowing any functions not in the standard fn or mappingRules namespaces.

## Release 1.2.0 (2017-07-10) ##

1. Fixed bug with {D} on role attribute if a role value contained a space
1. Fixed bug in JSON to XML Conversion of attribute policy
1. Added new call to validate policy given a JSONNode
1. Added XPath validation to disallow doc and doc-available functions in policy path expressions
1. Added support for {At()} and {Ats()} which provides direct access to attributes in a template

## Release 1.0.2 (2017-02-20) ##
1. Fixed a bug where an empty extension attribute value creates a malformed SAMLResponse
1. Fixed a bug where specifying an attribute name that started with a digit caused a failure
1. Fixed a bug where the correct ClassLoader was not properly setup in Saxon
1. Clean up : Added project directories to ensure that all projects can compile locally
