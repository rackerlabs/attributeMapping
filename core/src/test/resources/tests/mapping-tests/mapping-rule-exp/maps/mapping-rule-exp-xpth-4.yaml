    Simple policy where we select required attributes. We use At
    instead of Pts as a simple means of accessing an name SAML
    attribute.
  rules:
  - local:
      user:
        domain: "{At(domain)}"
        name:   "{Pt(/saml2p:Response/saml2:Assertion/saml2:Subject/saml2:NameID)}"
        email:  "{At(email)}"
        roles:  "{Ats(roles)}"
        expire: "{Pt(/saml2p:Response/saml2:Assertion/saml2:Subject/saml2:SubjectConfirmation/saml2:SubjectConfirmationData/@NotOnOrAfter)}"
