# AttributeMapping

## Intro

This project contains a an implementation of the Mapping Combinations
policy format that's utilized by OpenStack to map an Identity
Provider's Federated Attributes to local Attributes understood by the
service providers implementation.

A description of the Mapping Combinations policy format can be found
here:

http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/federation/federated_identity.html#mapping-combinations

There are some differences between the OpenStack format described
above and the format implemented here (these are described below)
however the concepts and much of the format is compatible.

The main idea is that a SAML Request is sent to the identity
provider -- if a Mapping Policy exists then the policy translates
this SAML Request into one the Identity System can understand.

The current implementation is non-destructive which means it simply
adds a new Assertion to the Request that contains only the mapped
attributes -- with the idea that the Identity System will process the
new assertion.  The initial assertion is kept on the request -- and
the signature of that assertion can still be verified.

## Building CLI utilities

You can interact with the policy engine with CLI utilities to build
these utilities you will need.

1. Java 1.8
2. Maven 3.3 (https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)
3. GCC C compiler

Once you've installed these in the main directory simply type:

````shell
mvn install
````

You'll need to have Maven and Java in the system path.  Next add the
```bin``` directory to your system path. 

## The Docker way

### Using the built image

Check the version of attribmap

````shell
docker run -ti  -v $(pwd):/opt/dima -w=/opt/dima dadean/attribmap --help
Starting nailgun server...
Missing parameter(s): policy, assertion

Attribute Mapper Nailgun Server v2.2.1-SNAPSHOT

Usage: attribmap [OPTIONS] policy assertion [output]

OPTIONS

-D
--dont-validate          Disable Validation (Validation will be enabled by
                         default)

-h
--help                   Display usage.

-s
--saml                   Output in SAML format

--version                Display version.

-x xsd-engine
--xsd-engine xsd-engine  XSD Engine to use. Valid values are auto, saxon,
                         xerces (default is auto)

PARAMETERS

policy     Attribute mapping policy

assertion  The assertion to translate based on policy

output     Output file. If not specified, stdout will be used.
````

Create a policy.yaml with a mapping policy and assert.xml with a SAML response

````shell
docker run -ti  -v $(pwd):/opt/dima -w=/opt/dima dadean/attribmap policy.yaml assert.xml
Starting nailgun server...
Xerces validation
 {
  "local": {
    "user": {
      "domain":"domain123",
      "name":"Userb4b9c279-7981-40d5-a778-c423872ab733",
      "email":"",
      "expire":"2017-11-03T22:36:33.060Z"
     },
    "faws": {
      "groups": {
        "value": [
          
         ],
        "multiValue":true
       }
     }
   }
 }
 ````

 You can also run a specific version by specifying the tag (currently only supports 2.2.1)

### Building locally

````shell
docker build -t attribmap .
docker run -ti --rm attribmap --help
````

## CLI utilities

1. attribmap : given a Mapping Policy and a SAML Request -- displays
standard attributes according to the mapping.  OR if the ```-s```
flag is used, then outputs a modified SAML Request with a new assertion.

1. attribmap2xml : converts a JSON policy to XML, cus XML is
beautiful.

1. attribmap2json : converts an XML policy to JSON, cus JSON rocks!

1. attribmap2xsl : converts a Mapping Policy to an XSL 2.0 stylesheet
that can be used to efficiently translate SAML Request so that it
contains a new assertion with the mapped attributes.

1. attribmap2yaml : converts a JSON policy to YAML.

## Differences from OpenStack Policy

## Tests

A test suite is here:

https://github.com/rackerlabs/attributeMapping/tree/master/core/src/test/resources/tests/mapping-tests

Each test suite is a directory with two subdirectories:

1. ```maps``` : contain different versions of a Mapping Policy which
are functionally equivalent.

2. ```asserts``` : contain different SAML assertions that will work
with the policy.

The SAML assertions are annotated with XPath 2.0 expressions at the
beginning of the file like this:

````xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<!-- There should be two assertions -->
<?assert count(/saml2p:Response/saml2:Assertion) = 2 ?>

<!-- There should be 2 roles -->
<?assert count(mapping:get-attributes('roles')) = 2?>

<!-- The roles should be nova:observer and lbaas:observer -->
<?assert mapping:get-attributes('roles')='lbaas:observer' and mapping:get-attributes('roles')='nova:observer' ?>

<!-- None of the roles should not be lbaas:admin or nova:admin -->
<?assert every $r in mapping:get-attributes('roles') satisfies not($r = ('lbaas:admin', 'nova:admin'))?>

<!-- The name should be john.doe -->
<?assert /saml2p:Response/saml2:Assertion[1]/saml2:Subject/saml2:NameID = 'john.doe'?>

<!-- The message should expire at 2013-11-17T16:19:06.298Z -->
<?assert /saml2p:Response/saml2:Assertion[1]/saml2:Subject/saml2:SubjectConfirmation/saml2:SubjectConfirmationData/@NotOnOrAfter = '2013-11-17T16:19:06.298Z'?>

<!-- The email should be  John Doe &lt;john.doe@323676.rackspace.com&gt; -->
<?assert mapping:get-attribute('email') = 'no-reply@rackspace.com'?>

<!-- The email should be no-reply@rackspace.com -->
<?assert mapping:get-attribute('domain') = '323676'?>

<saml2p:Response ID="_7fcd6173-e6e0-45a4-a2fd-74a4ef85bf30" 
````

These assertions are made on the converted SAML and the test passes
only if they all validate to true.

There are a number of built in functions the XPath implementation
understands:

1. ```mapping:get-attributes()```  : Takes a name of an attribute and
returns a sequence of all of its values -- only in the FIRST
(translated) assertion.

1. ```mapping:get-attribute()```  : Does the same as above but only
returns the first value.

1. ```mapping:get-expire()``` : Gets the expiration time as an
```xs:dateTime`` so you can do assertions based on time. 

If a test fails, then take a look in the
```core/target/surefire-reports/``` directory.

That directory will contain txt files with a detailed explanation on
why a test failed.
